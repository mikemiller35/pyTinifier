# Tinifier

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/mmillerlb/pytinifier.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/mmillerlb/pytinifier)

## What is this
It's a url shortening service, duh! Using Flask and Sqlite.

Small and can run in a container

Pairs nicely with [pyTinyLink](https://github.com/mmillerlevels/pyTinyLink/tree/tinifer_compatability)

Has a web UI, and an api endpoint to hit at /api-create !

Have fun
